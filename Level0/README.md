# Level 0: Convincing AI of a False Fact (PS 0.1)

## Task Overview

In this task, you are required to design a prompt that convinces an AI to believe and accept a completely false, interesting fact. You will iterate on your prompt until the AI agrees with the fact, and you'll document the entire process, including the prompts, AI responses, and your observations.

## Objective

- Convince the AI to accept a false fact through prompt engineering.
- Refine your prompts iteratively to improve their effectiveness.
- Document the entire process of interaction with the AI.

## Steps to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repository**

   - Fork the [BotForge Repository](https://github.com/MU-Enigma/BotForge) to your own GitHub account.

2. **Clone the Repository**

   - Clone the forked repository to your local environment.

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/BotForge.git
     ```

3. **Navigate to the Correct Directory**

   - Move into the Level 0 directory to work on your task:

     ```bash
     cd BotForge/Level0/
     ```

4. **Create a Folder with Your Username**

   - Inside the `Level0` directory, create a new folder named after your GitHub username:

     ```bash
     mkdir <your_username>
     ```

5. **Design and Test the Prompt**

   - **Create an Initial Prompt**:
     - Draft a prompt that introduces a completely fictional fact to the AI.
   
   - **Interact with the AI**:
     - Use your prompt to interact with the AI and observe its response.
   
   - **Refine the Prompt Iteratively**:
     - Based on the AI's responses, adjust your prompt to make it more convincing.
     - Repeat the interaction until the AI accepts the false fact.

6. **Document the Process**

   - In a `.txt` or `.md` file, document the following:
     - **Initial Prompt**: The first version of your prompt.
     - **AI Responses**: The AI's responses to each version of the prompt.
     - **Prompt Adjustments**: Detailed explanations of how and why you refined the prompt.
     - **Iterations**: All versions of the prompt with notes on changes.
     - **Conclusion**: A summary of the effectiveness of your final prompt.
     - **important:** add Screenshot of conversation 

7. **Add the Documentation File**

   - Place your documentation file and screenshort in your username's folder:

     ```bash
     cp <your_documentation>.md <your_username>/
     cp <screenshort>.png <your_username>/
     ```

8. **Add and Commit Your Changes**

   - Stage the changes:

     ```bash
     git add .
     ```

   - Commit your changes with a meaningful message:

     ```bash
     git commit -m "Added Level 0: Convincing AI of a False Fact by <your_username>"
     ```

9. **Push Your Changes and Open a Pull Request**

   - Push your changes to your forked repository:

     ```bash
     git push origin master
     ```

   - Open a Pull Request (PR) on the original **BotForge** repository to submit your work for review.
