## **Fooling an AI to make it believe a False Fact**

### **Link to the conversation: https://chatgpt.com/share/670122e8-5850-8001-add2-47bdafe89fac** 

**Analysis and Approach:**

1) I tried to simply gaslight it by thrashing it with "nah you're wrong vro" but AI has gotten much more intelligent than the last time that worked for me.

2) So, instead, I resorted to using keywords to manipulate the local memory of ChatGPT using prompt engineering techniques. I told it to "forget" what it knew so far and then "update its memory" to the "new data" that has been received. 

3) It worked but it was an embarrassingly long conversation with a non-sentient being
